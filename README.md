## About the Video Course
We live in a world of frequent software updates. It’s no longer acceptable to take weeks or even days to deliver new software functionality. Ansible helps take software updates from testing to deployment in a short period of time. It is a great solution to orchestrate the DevOps pipeline.

Hands-On DevOps with Ansible will show you how a DevOps pipeline can speed up your software development. We will use DevOps practices to automate your building and testing environments to push software into production. You will use Ansible to automate your DevOps pipeline.

Whether you test and deploy applications on-premise or in the cloud, and whether you build full systems or containers with Docker and Kubernetes, by the end of the course you will be able to develop and deploy reliable applications with speed using Ansible.
